        <h2 align="center">Tips on Making the Perfect Bacon Egg and Cheese</h2>
    
        
    
        <ul>
            <li>Grilled cheese sandwich recipes aren’t just for lunch or dinner, add a scrambled egg and some bacon for a yummy breakfast version.</li> <br />
            <li>Avoid cast iron. Eggs scrambled in a cast iron skillet can turn a greenish shade. This harmless but unappealing color change is the result of a chemical reaction between iron in the pan and sulfur in egg whites.</li> <br />
            <li>Don’t overcook. The heat retained in the pan will continue to cook and firm up the eggs after pan is removed from heat.</li> <br />
            <li>How long to beat? It’s a matter of preference. Light beating produces more dense scrambled eggs. Vigorous beating aerates the eggs, resulting in lighter fluffier curds.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 align="center">Goal of the Website</h2>
    <p>
        Our founder, Charlie Doe, had an idea to create a restaurant that was more than a place that served great food. <br />
        Charlie wanted to give locals a place where they'd always feel at home. A place where they could get no-nonsense <br />
        food at down-to-earth prices, and where they'd be treated right by people who had a passion to serve. The culture <br />
        at the Uber Cafe was instilled by Charlie Doe long before a mission statement was ever written down <br />
        on paper and is still evident today. At Uber Cafe, team members and community are all treated with respect.
