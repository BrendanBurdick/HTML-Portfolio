        &reg; Uber Café, located in Mendon, Massachusetts, offers a great selection of premium coffees, teas, and espresso for your enjoyment. We also offer fresh baked pastries and treats, as well as a <br />
        selection of freshly prepared lunch and dinner items. We pride ourselves on using locally grown ingredients. We only use locally grown eggs from Blackstone Valley Farm and we proudly <br />
        serve local milk from Maple Farms. We love to invent new baked goods using in-house ingredients from our pantry, as well as seasonal items. You never know what we will think of next!
