                    The goal of this website is to serve as a portfolio that showcases both my work throughout the Intro to HTML course, as well as personal work that I've completed throughout my schooling. I've also included an HTML copy of my resume for your viewing pleasure. <br/><br/>
                    
                    Programming is a passion of mine. I took a Java programming course in my senior year of high school, and after that I knew what I wanted to do for a career. The feeling of solving a problem by manipulating computers is honestly the coolest thing to me, and I love doing it! That is one of the reasons why I chose this course. The purpose of HTML is to take information and to display it meaningfully and effectively on a user's screen (no matter what the size is). Professor Breuning has helped us do this by covering the concepts of tags, elements, attributes, media query, forms, tables, the box model, and many other HTML and Javascript concepts.<br/><br/>
                    
                    My major in college is Computer Science and I have a minor in Mathematics. I think it goes without saying that I love numbers. My goal coming out of college is to be a software engineer, and I think I have what it takes to become one. <br />
