                LBS Clinic is partnered with a number of companies in the industry.

                LBS Clinic is a Premier Scouting Partner for Baseball America, the leading source in the nation for in-depth articles on high school, college, minor league and major league baseball players. LBS Clinic's scouting staff provides Baseball America with detailed scouting reports on the thousands of players seen throughout the year. <br /><br />

                LBS Clinic announced a strategic partnership with "Little League International" in March 2009 in order to provide youth players worldwide with increased player development and college placement opportunities. Little League International named LBS Clinic as the Exclusive and Official Player Development Partner of Little League Baseball. <br /><br />
            
                LBS Clinic announced a partnership with EyeBlack.com in November 2011. EyeBlack.com, the official EyeBlack of athletes and fans, will have a significant presence at LBS Clinic events. <br /><br />

            <h2 id="Biography">Let Me Introduce Myself...</h2>
                I have always been an achiever; be it academics or professional life or sports or any other field in my life. I believe in success through hard work and dedication. My motto in life is to 'If you want something, work hard and you will achieve it; there are no shot cuts'. I enjoy life to the fullest and love humour. I am a progressive thinker and respect each person's space and values. Here is a picture of me (left) with a coach of mine (right).
