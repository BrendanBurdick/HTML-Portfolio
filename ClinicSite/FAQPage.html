                   <dd>At this point, practices will be scheduled based on the availability of the players. Once the players have signed up, I will ask what their availability is, and from there a schedule will be decided.</dd><br /><br />

                   <dd>The average season will begin in the middle of May and end around the middle of September. The season has the potential to go longer if our team makes the playoffs as well.</dd><br /><br />

                   <dd>Training seasons will be roughly 1.5 months each, and there will be two training seasons.  The first training season will run from November until Christmas. The second training season will run from February until April.</dd>
